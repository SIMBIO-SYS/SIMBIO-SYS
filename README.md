# SIMBIO-SYS
Crucial information to analyze the geological and mineralogical characteristics of the Mercury surface and exosphere will come from the integrated package Spectrometer and Imagers for MPO BepiColombo-Integrated Observatory SYStem (**SIMBIO-SYS**), which includes imaging systems with stereo (**STC**) and high spatial resolution (**HRIC**) capabilities along with a hyperspectral imager (**VIHI**) in the visible-near-infrared range.
SIMBIO-SYS investigation can count on a very high spatial resolution, coverage, strict complementary on the spectral range for mineralogical mapping, and high stereo-derived topography accuracy.

The SIMBIO-SYS capabilities will allow obtaining an integrated picture of the planet combining information on the surface geology, topography, and composition. The level of details and the expected global mapping will unveil crucial characteristics of the Mercury, which will help reconstruct the overall evolution of the planet. A comprehensive list of the scientific themes for the surface studies for the BepiColombo mission is given in (Rothery et al., 2010).
